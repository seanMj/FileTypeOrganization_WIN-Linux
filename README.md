# FileTypeOrganization_Windows
File Type (Extension) Organizer, takes files, gets extension type, then places the file of type into folder of type for easier analysis or searching by the user.

this folder is like the other version but will work instantly in Visual Studio, not faffing about. No changes made to main.cpp just making it easier on the user.
